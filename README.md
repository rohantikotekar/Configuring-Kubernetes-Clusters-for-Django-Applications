# Configuring Kubernetes Clusters for Python Applications


## Introduction

As organizations move towards cloud-native architectures, deploying applications in containers on Kubernetes has become a standard. Kubernetes offers powerful features like auto-healing, scaling, and rolling updates, which are essential for maintaining the health and availability of applications.

In this project, a Python application is containerized and deployed onto a Kubernetes cluster. We leverage Kubernetes features like ReplicaSets, Deployments, and Services to ensure the application is robust, scalable, and self-healing.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- **Docker:** Installed and configured for building container images.
- **Kubernetes Cluster:** Set up locally with Minikube or remotely with any cloud provider (e.g., GKE, EKS, AKS).
- **kubectl:** Installed and configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Helm (optional):** For package management in Kubernetes.
- **Python 3.x:** Installed for running the application.


## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-k8s-deploy.git
cd python-k8s-deploy

cd app
docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/python-app:latest .

Push the Docker Image to a Registry
Tag and push the Docker image to your Docker Hub or any other container registry:
docker push your-dockerhub-username/python-app:latest

## Kubernetes Configuration
Create a Namespace
Itâ€™s a good practice to separate environments and resources using namespaces:
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml

## Deploy the Application
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

## ReplicaSets
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

##Set Up a Service
Expose the application using a Kubernetes Service to allow communication within the cluster and external access:
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml

## Auto-Healing and Self-Healing
Kubernetes automatically handles pod restarts in case of failure. This is defined in the Deployment specification with a restartPolicy. To enforce more robust self-healing capabilities, Kubernetes can restart the pods automatically upon failure.

The liveness probe in the deployment configuration ensures that unhealthy pods are detected and terminated, allowing new ones to start:
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 30
  timeoutSeconds: 5

## Scaling with ReplicaSets
ReplicaSets are defined in the deployment.yaml file to ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times:


spec:
  replicas: 3  # Desired number of replicas
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: python-app
To adjust the number of replicas manually:


kubectl scale deployment python-app --replicas=5
To automatically scale based on CPU utilization, apply the HPA configuration:


kubectl apply -f k8s/hpa.yaml

## Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment (CD) can be implemented using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions. A CI/CD pipeline can be set up to:

Build and test the application.
Build the Docker image.
Push the image to a container registry.
Update the Kubernetes deployment.
A sample GitHub Actions workflow could look like:

name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Build and push Docker image
        run: |
          docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/python-app:$GITHUB_SHA .
          docker push your-dockerhub-username/python-app:$GITHUB_SHA

      - name: Deploy to Kubernetes
        run: |
          kubectl set image deployment/python-app python-app=your-dockerhub-username/python-app:$GITHUB_SHA

## Monitoring and Logging
For monitoring and logging, tools like Prometheus and Grafana can be integrated. Kubernetes metrics-server provides resource usage metrics, which can be monitored to set up alerting mechanisms.
